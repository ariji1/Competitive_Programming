# a helper fn to convert from my preferred lisp list_tree format
# to nodey binary trees

# Coming from lisp, I like to see trees implemented in pure list
# structures, [1 [2 21 22] [3 31 32]] if only because they are easy to
# visualize and to create as tests. I refer to such trees here as a
# list_tree

# however, interviewcake prefers a more java/c traditional
# [node, ptr_left, ptr_right] structure so I have added a few routines
# that let me create testcases using lisplike trees and then
# converting them to ptrful trees.
